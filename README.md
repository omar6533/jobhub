For the students who are near to graduation from college after they complete their learning journey to have employer-based so they are ready to get in the industry and get offers from companies. The JobHub system is a Mobile-based system. That is a students placements system allow the students to address their achievements during the colleague journey like academic records, volunteering experience, club activities, and skills they gained. Unlike current systems which it is more worldwide to people even after graduation or people without a degree where they can share anything of what they know to find jobs, JobHub is a system for students related to a chosen colleague where there is control of the people who are allowed to use it. Our product is a system that will allow the students to have their profile, resume creation and job recommendation where the employee can search about them easily and quickly with some criteria to match the job they looking for, and a place to schedule an interview, give feedback, and rating for the students.
